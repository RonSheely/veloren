## Welcome to Veloren!

Veloren is an action-adventure RPG game set in a vast fantasy world. It is inspired by other games such as Cube World, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.

Veloren is in active development and enjoys a flourishing player community.

## Get Veloren

We provide builds for Windows, macOS and Linux.
The game can be downloaded on our website:

<https://veloren.net/download>

Due to rapid game development, stable versions become outdated fast
and might be **incompatible with the public server**.

It is recommended to use [Airshipper](https://book.veloren.net/players/airshipper.html),
the official game launcher, to keep your game up-to-date easily.

If you prefer to compile the game yourself, follow the instructions
in our [book](https://book.veloren.net/contributors/introduction.html).

## FAQ

### **Q:** How is this game licensed?

**A:** **It is free to play, modify and distribute. Forever.**
Since it is a community project, we decided to license it under the **[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html)**,
which means it will always stay free and open source.

### **Q:** What platforms are supported?

**A:** Veloren can run on Windows, macOS and Linux on a great range of CPU architectures.
However, the x86_64 architecture is the main focus in development.
Official builds for the ARM64 architecture are also provided for macOS and Linux.
It is likely possible to compile the game on other platforms as well.

### **Q:** Do you accept donations?

**A:** You can support the project financially on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/veloren) page.
