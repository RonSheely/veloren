### This component hosts keys that are used in multiple places in UI
###
### Also, keys that don't fit into the existing files in the other UI
### components (such as those in the `hud` folder) can be placed here.
### This is part of an effort to minimize the creation of new localization
### files because:
### * New files have to be manually added as new components in weblate before
###   they can be translated.
### * Since the Weblate UI is used for translation, there is less need to limit
###   the size of files for making navigation easier.
